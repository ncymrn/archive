welcome to my personal website! i made this website to keep all my personal projects in one place.
i love the aesthetics of the old web, so please keep in mind that i've made a lot of stylistic choices 
for my personal site that i wouldn't do normally, such as having a lot of fun but unnecessary javascript.
